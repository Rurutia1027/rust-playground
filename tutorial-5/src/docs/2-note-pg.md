# Notes of Postgre's `pg_notify` Function

### What's `pg_notify`

`pg_notify` is a PostgreSQL function which is used to send a notification on a specified channel('cache-update' in this case). When called, it takes two arguments:

- _Channel Name_: The name of the channel to which the notification will be sent.
- _Payload_: A message or data that you want to send with the notification.

### Purpose of `pg_notify`

- _Channel Notifications_: The purpose of calling `pg_notify` is to notify all listeners(which could be any application or service listen for events on that channel) that something has happened.

### Other Operations with `pg_notify`

While `pg_notify` itself is a simple notification mechanism, it can be used in various ways:

- **Broadcasting Events:** It's primarly used to broadcast events within the application. For instance, other parts of our system may want to know when the cache has been updated and react to it accordingly.

- **Triggering Background Jobs:** After receiving a notification, we migh trigger a background job to refresh data, synchronzie caches, or even log the event.

- **Database Triggers:** We can also use triggers in the database that react to changes in tables or certain conditions. For instance, we might publish a notification every time a specific table is modified.
- **Complex Business Logic:**: Notificaitons can be used to coordinate complex operations. For example, notifying different services when a product price changes, or when some state needs to by synchronized.
