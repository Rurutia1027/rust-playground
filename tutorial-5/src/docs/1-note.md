# Health Service

For now Health Service monitors the cache update duration as a crucial statistic factor.
This factor represent the overall health of the system because it directly tied to the effciency and
stability of the services that rely on the cache.
Specificially, the cache in our system is likely serving critical data for APIs or other parts of our applicaiton,
and the freshness of that data is important for proper functionality.

### Why Cache Updates Status Represents Health

- 1. **Cache as a Data Layer**
- The Cache stores data that is frequently accessed by services, such as API or database queries, to improve performance and reduce load. When the cache is updated, it reflects that system's actively maintaining this layer of data.
- If the cache

### Additional Metrics to Add

While cache udpates are a key metric, here are a few other system health indicators you might track alongside cache status:

- **Service Uptime:** Measure the overall uptime of the services. This can help identify if the cache updates are being interrpted by service downtime.
- **Database Latency:** If the cache update relies on database calls, monitoring database latency can highlight potential delays or failures in data retrieval.
- **API Response Times:** Track the response time of your APIs to ensure that returning fresh data quickly.
- **Resource Usage(CPU, Memory, Disk):**: These metrics can highlight if the system is under heavy load, potentially affecting cache updates.
