# Understand Issuance in Beacon Chain

In the context of Ethereum's **Beacon Chain**, **issuance** refers to the **creation of new ETH** as rewards for validators in the **Proof-of-Stake(PoS)** consensus mechanism.

## What is Issuance ?

- **Issuance** is the process of mining new ETH as a reward for network participants.
- In Ethereum's **Proof-of-Stake** system (the Beacon Chain), validators are incentivized to propose and attest to blocks correctly. These incentives are paid out as **newly issued ETH**, which increases the total supply of ETH over time.
- This is similar to how miners were rewarded in **Proof-of-Work(PoW)** pre-Merge, but in **PoS**, the rewards go to validators instead of miners.

## Why Does the Beacon Chain Issue ETH ?

The issuance mechanism serves the follow purposes:

### Incentivize Validators

- Validators must stake **32 ETH** to participate in block validation.
- Issuance (rewards) encourages validators to maintain the network's security, propose new blocks, and attest to the blocks propsed by others.

### Secure the Network

- Validators earn rewards for behaving honestly (proposing/attesting to valid blocks).
- Misbehavior, like being offline or submitting malicious attestations, results in penalties or slashing.

### Sustain Network Operations

- ETH issuance ensures validators are eonomically incentivized to participate over the long term.

## How Issuance Works on the Beacon Chain?

#### **ETH Rewards** are issued to validators based on their **performance**:

- Proposing a block
- Attesting to other blocks
- Participant in sync committees(helping the chain's finality).

#### Validators earn both **base rewards** and **additional rewards** for correctly contributing to consensus

#### Source of Issurance

- New ETH created at the protocol level as validator rewards.
- This issuance increases the total ETH supply, but with **burn mechanisms** (like EIP-1559 on the execution layer), issuance can be offest by burned ETH.
