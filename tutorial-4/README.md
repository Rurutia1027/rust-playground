# Web3-Indexing-Lab

In this `tutorial-4`, we document notes, scripts, and practices related to [Graph Node](). It includes deploying, debugging, and testing Graph Node in a Docker environment, working with real-world blockchain datasets, and configuring local mock blockchain datasets. Additionally we cover creating and customizing manifest files for defining subgraphs. 

## ðŸš€ 0. What's Graph Node ? 
The GraphNode in the Graph ecosystem serves as a critical component for indexing and querying blockchain data. Acting as a middleware between `off-chain` applicaitons(dApps) and `on-chain` datasets, it bridges the gap by offering powerful abstractions for handling blockchain data.

GraphNode's core functinality lies its abilities to: 
* Index Blockchain Events: 
* Define Flexible Query Models: 
* Integrate with GraphSQL APIs: 

It's elegance stems from ability to abstract complex blockchain data into a graph-like structure, enabling developers to: 
* Define custom query rules through subgraph manifests. 
* Seamlessly execute these rules on blockchain datasets(both real-world and mock/test datasets).
* Retrieve structured results via a standardized GraphQL API. 

This design not only simplifies the complexities of interacting with blockchain data but also empowers Web3 developers to create, test, and deploy dApp backends that efficiently interact with decentralized networks.
