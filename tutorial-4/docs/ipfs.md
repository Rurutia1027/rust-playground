# Understanding IPFS in GraphNode and Blockchain 

As we mention, the steps we need to follow if we want to subscribe blockchain dataset from some specific blockchain platform.

At that time, we mentioned `IPFS` in the step 2 that we need to configure the endpoint of IPFS service in the `subgraph.yml`. 

More than that, we also mentioned we need first deploy the docker env for `IPFS` when we need deploy the development environment for GraphNode. 

```yaml 
ipfs:
  environment: 
    ipfs: 'http://localhost:5001'
```

**So what's IPFS exactly, what role it play in GraphNode and in the Blockchain?**
