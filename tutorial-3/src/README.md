# Blockchain in Rust 

This repository is based on [Blockchain-Rust](https://github.com/GeekLaunch/blockchain-rust/). I've done a little job in my repo, like refined the existing implementations by adding more detailed logs and comments. Additionally, I've made an attempt to implement smart contracts within this repository.

What I appreciate most about this [project](https://github.com/GeekLaunch/blockchain-rust/) are the clear and simple definitions and explanations provided in the tutorial series. They have been extermely helpful in giving me a quick and thorough understanding of blockchain concepts, as well as their definitions and implementations using Rust.
