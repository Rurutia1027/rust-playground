ERC-20 is a **token standard** on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules that all fungible tokens (tokens that are identical and interchangeable) must follow, ensuring compatibility between smart contracts and decentralized application(dApps). This standard makes it easier to create and interact with tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem.
