# Understand ERC-20

In our previous notes, we discussed [Ethereum](./0-Ethereum.md) and explored various protocols like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, highlighting their differences. Among these, **ERC-20** stands out as the foundation of Smart Contracts and plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem.

To gain a deeper understanding of ERC-20 , I plan to add detailed nots about its origin, the challenges developers faced in the Ethereum ecosystem before its innovation, and how ERC-20 addressed those issues. Additionally, I'll include pseudocode for ERC-20 data structures and its key associated functions to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Before ERC-20: The Problem Space

### Fragmentation of Token Standards

- Before ERC-20, there were no standardized ways to create, manage, or exchange tokens on Ethereum.
- Developers created custom smart contracts for each token, leading to significant variations in functionality and structure .
- Lack of standardization meant that wallets, exchange, and dApps had to build custom integrations for each tokne, creating inefficiencies.

### Manual and Inconsitent Exchange Mechanisms

- Exchanging tokens required complex, manual processes.
- Users had to interact with bespoke smart contracts, which often lead to errors, such as sending tokens to **incompatible addresses ** or **incorrect smart contract methods**.

### Scalability Challenges

Early blockchain-based systems could not support a thriving ecosystem of interoperable tokens. This stifled innovaiton and made it harder bo build decentrailized applications(dApps) that interacted with multiple tokens.

### Limited Programmability

Without a token standard, developers had to re-implement fundamental functions like tracking balances or transferring ownership for every project. This was inefficient and prone to bugs.

## The ROle of ERC-20: Why It Was Revolutionary

ERC-20, introduced in 2015, was desiged to standardize token creation and interactions on Ethereum. Here is why it is significant:

### Interoperability

- ERC-20 defined a **common interface** for tokens. Wallets, exchanges, and dApps could now interact with and ERC-20 token using the same set of methods (`transfer`, `approve`, `balanceOf`, etc.).
- This eliminated the need for custom integration and enabled seamless interactions between tokens and platforms.

### Automation and Programmability

- Functions like `balanceOf` and `transferFrom` simplified balance checking and token transfers, making them automated and error-resistant.
- Developers could build complex decentralized applications (DeFi protocols, gams, marketplaces) that relied on these standardized functions.

### Decentralized Exchanges

- ERC-20 enabled the creation of decentalized exchanges(DEXs) where tokens could be traded automatically through smart contracts (e.g., Unsawp).
- This was a game-changer, as it eliminated reliance on centralized intermediaries for token trading.

### Ecosystem Growth

- By providing a standard, ERC-20 reduced barriers to entry for developers. This lead to the explosion of tokenized assets like:
  > Utility tokens for dApps.
  > Governance tokens for DAOs.
  > Stablecoins like USDT, USDC.

## Key Features and Innovations of ERC-20

### Address-Based Token Ownership

### Allowance and Approval Mechainism

### Total Supply Standardization

The `totalSupply` function provided a way to query the total number of tokens issued, ensuring transparency.

### Event Logging

Events like `Transfer` and `Approval` enabled off-chain applications to track token transactions and approvals easily.

## Difference Between Exchange and 'Exchange' of Tokens in Blockchain ?

During learning blockchain basic concept, I often consused about the term `Exchange` and `Exchange Tokens Between Addresses`.
As a freshman like me get confused about this two concepts is easy, so I decide write down the difference between `Exchange` and `exchange tokens via Blockchain`.

### Exchange

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, an **Exchange** typically refers to:

**A Platform for Trading**

- A cryptocurrency exchange is a marketplace where users can **buy**, **sell**, or **trade cryptocurrencies**(e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or ERC-20 tokens).

- Types of Exchanges:

* **Centrailized Exchanges(CEXs)**

  > Platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
  > Operated by a central authority.
  > Require users to trust the platform with their funds.
  > Often offer advanced trading features(e.g., margin trading, futures)

* **Decentrailized Exchanges(DEXs)**
  > Platforms like **Uniswap** **SushiSwap** and **PanacksSwap**
  > Operate on a blockchain (smart contracts manage trades)
  > Users retain control their funds(no intermediaries).
  > Often used for swapping ERC-20 tokens directly.

### Exchange Tokens via Address

This refers to **transferring tokens directly** from one blockchain address to another.

- **What it Means**

* It involves sending tokens from **one wallet or account address** to another.
* The transfer is executed using blockchain transactions.
* No intermediary(like a exchange) is required for the transaction.

- **How It Relates to ERC-20**

ERC-20 tokens provide standard functions for transferring tokens between addresses:

- `transfer(address to, uint256 value):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens to the `to` address.
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address.
  > This function often used in scenarios involving smart contracts.

## Post-ERC-20: Expanding The Ethereum EcoSystem

ERC-20 laid the foundaiton for Ethereum's token economy, but newer standards like ERC-721(NFTs) and ERC-1155(multi-token standard) expanded on its principles to meet emerging needs.

## How [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) Relates to ERC-20?

Platforms like Etherscan provide an interface to interact with and query data from **smart contracts**. Etherscan isn't specific to ERC-20, but it provide APIs for:

**Querying token balances**

**Tracking transactions**

**Getting Allowances(if public)**

- relationship between **owner** and **spender** in ERC-20

- understand **allowance** scenario in ERC-20

- understand **approve** scenario in ERC-20

- understand **transfer_from** scenario in ERC-20

- understand ERC-20 functions in house buying process logic

### ERC20 in Rust

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct ERC20 {
  // balances:
  // key:address;
  // value: balance amount
  balances: HashMap<String, u256>,

  // allowances:
  // key: owner
  // value: (spender -> spender's balance amount)
  allowances: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, u256>>,

  // total_supply: total supply of the token
  total_supply: u256
}

impl ERC20 {
  fn new(total_supply: u256) -> Self {
    let mut balances = HashMap::new();
    balances.insert("creator".to_string(), total_supply);

    Self {
      balances,
      allowances: HashMap::new(),
      total_supply,
    }
  }

  // get the balance amount by providing the address
  fn balance_of(&self, address: &str) -> u256 {
    *self.balances.get(address).unwrap_or(&0)
  }

  // transfer the amount of balance from 'from' address, to 'to' address
  fn transfer(&mut self, from: &str, to: &str, amount: u256) -> Result<(), String> {
    // first, get total amount of balance via the from address
    let from_balance = self.balances.get(from).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    // if from address's balance value < transfer amount value, return error message
    if from_balance < amount {
      return Err("Insufficient balance".into());
    }

    // minus corresponding amount of value from from address balance
    // and update the remain amount of the balance of the from address to the `balance` hash map
    self.balances.insert(from.into(), from_balance - amount);

    // get to address's balance value from `balances` hash map
    // if no to address's balance amount value, return 0 is ok
    let to_balance = self.balances.get(to).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    // add correspoinding amount of value to to address balance amount value
    // and update the (key, value) pair of (to address, updated to balance amount value) to the hash map of balances
    self.balances.insert(to.into(), to_balance + amount);

    // return ok
    Ok(())
  }


  // owner: owner of the token in the blockchain, represented by an address {either from or to address} wallet address
  // spender: object of authorized, like 3rd party or platform
  // approve: this function's definition means,
  // `owner` authorize a `spender` how many amout of the token the spender can use.
  // spender like the proxy of the owner to deal with some specific scenraios like buy stocks, buy foods or buy houses
  // then, owner owns its total tokens, and can authorize its tokens to multiple spender(s)
  // that's why owner:spender => 1:N
  // that's why in ERC-20 standard, allowance is defined as Map<String, Map<String, u256>>
  // the outer layer of Map key is the owner -> the address of wallet
  // the inner layer of Map key is the multiple proxies(spenders) and the tokens the owner deposited to the spenders
  // like you have 100 tokens --> this is your balance total amount, your total supply
  // and you have multiple wallet account address --> this is stored inside your balance this hash map
  // and despoite 10 tokens for food-spenders to buy Macolado humbergers
  // and desposite 20 tokens for buying NVIDIA stocks
  // and despoiste 50 tokens for buying houses in your country
  // and the remained tokens are stored in the balances and total_supply
  fn approve(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, amount: u256) {
    // here we get all owner's allowance list by owner value
    let owner_allowances = self.allowances.entry(owner.into()).or_default();

    // insert a new allowance item to the owner's allowance hash map
    // add a new proxy for the owner by limited amount of token
    owner_allowances.insert(spender.into(), amount);
  }

  // this function provides get owner's proxy the spender's allowance amount value
  // if owner's allowance list does not have this given spender
  // return 0 is ok
  fn allowance(&self, owner: &str, spender: &str) -> u256 {
    self.allowances
      .get(owner)
      .and_then(|spender_map| spender_map.get(spender))
      .cloned()
      .unwrap_or(0)
  }

  fn transfer_from(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, target_account_address: &str, amount: u256) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Step 1:Retrieve the spender's remaining allowance for the owner's tokens.
    let allowance = self.allowance(owner, spender);

    // Check if the spender's allowance is sufficient for the transfer
    if allowance < amount  {
      // If authorized spender does not have enough allowance, the transfer fails
      return Err("Allowance exceeded".into());
    }

    // Step 2: Check if the owner's total balance is sufficient for the transfer
    let owner_balance = self.balances.get(owner).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    if owner_balance < amount {
      // If the owner's balance is insufficient, the transfer fails.
      return Err("Insufficient balance".into());
    }
    // Step 3: Deduct the transfer amount from the spender's allowance.
    self.allowances.get_mut(owner).unwrap().insert(spender.into(), allowance - amount);

    // Step 4: Deduct the transfer amount from the owner's balance.
    self.balances.insert(owner.into(), owner_balance - amount);


    // Step 5: Add the transfer amount to the target account's balance.
    let to_balance = self.balances.get(target_account_address).cloned().unwrap_or(0);
    self.balances.insert(target_account_address.into(), to_balance + amount);

    Ok(())
  }
}
```

### Why in Pseudocode `transfer_from` Deduct From Both Balance and Allowance

**Balance**:
This represents the total number of tokens owned by an address(owner in this case).
Deducing from the balance ensures that the owner's tokens are correctly updated to reflect the transfer.

**Allowance**:
The allowance represents the tokens that a spender(proxy) is authorized to transfer on behalf of the owner.
Deducting from the allowance ensures that the spender cannot exceed the owner's approval.

**Why Both Are Deducted?**
The balance represents the actual token holdings of the owner.
The allowance is a temporary authorization and does not reduce the owner's token holding until the spender use it. When a transfer occurs:

- The spender's **allowance** is reduced because they are consuming part of their permission to spend.
- THe owner's **balance** is reduced because the actual tokens are transferred to another account.

### How Allowances and Balances Relate to Total Supply?

**Total Supply**:
This is the toal number of tokens that exist, as defined by the smart contract.
It does not change during token transfer(unless tokens are minted or burned).

The sum of all balances across all accounts equals the **totalSupply**.

Actually i have to say in the pseudocode, all of the inner objects, like **balances**, **allowances** and **totalSupply** they are all belong to the global scoped of the Blockchain System.
They are not local variables, and each operation(CRUD) like add, update, query and delete all requires Gas Fee.

Value of totalSupply in ERC-20 is not the total balance amount of current owner, instead it is the global all accounts' balance amount add together's value.

**Balances**:
Balances track the actual ownership of tokens for each account, and each balance contributes to the total supply.

**Allowances**:
Allowances are unrelated to the **totalSupply** directly. They are temporary permissions granted by owners to spenders.
The sum of all allowances for an owner can never exceeded the owner's balance. This ensures that spender cannot use more tokens than the owner actually owns.
If owner authorized spender amount > the owner balances, then the transfer_from will be failed during the second validation `amount < balance` then the real `transfer_from` will be blocked.

# ERC-20 中的 allowance 和 代理机制设计理念

## 问题: 为什么 ERC-20 中要设置 `transfer_from` 这里分别在 balances & allowances 中的两次'扣费' 逻辑?

ERC-20 这样的设计理念是为了

- 授权管理: 明确代理使用权限, 代理的介入能够更好的在业务上实现资金转移的业务隔离和区分.
- 实际持有: 确保代币转移符合 Ethereum 运算逻辑.
- 错误处理: 类似数据库中的两阶段提交, 目的是为了能够让 Solidity 实现回滚防止未授权代币转移这种情况的发生.

但, 不仅如此, ERC-20 中的 allowance 和 spender(我将其理解为代理/proxy) 这种设计机制不仅是资金管理层面的业务隔离, 还为期能够和**智能合约** 的业务需求的设计与实现奠定基础, 并且能够很好的和智能合约的实现与运行衔接.

### 业务隔离

在不同的 balance transfer 业务场景中, `allowance` 和不同的代理 spenders 的引入可以更加有效地实现对资金的细粒度的控制.

#### 隔离业务逻辑

- 通过 `allowance` 代币的所有者可以为不同的代理(支付应用, 交易所等) 来设置单独的授权额度, 从而确保每个代理只能再起授权范围内操作, 而不会影响其他的授权行为.
- 例如, 一个账户授权 10 个代币用于支付应用(买咖啡), 又同时授权 100 个代币用于投资平台(购买股票). 这些授权彼此独立, 互相不会干扰.(实际上, 这个和授权系统中, 权限更加细粒度的切分十分类似).

#### 资金安全&风险控制

- 如果没有 `allowance` 机制, 那么所有的转账操作都有可能直接影响账户的余额, 这十分的容易造成安全隐患.
- 不过, 在引入 `allowance` 之后, 即便是代理方出了问题或者被滥用, 风险也会因为细粒度划分被控制在授权范围内.
- 这种机制可以类比于银行中的子账户或消费限额的设置, 即便是主账户有大量的余额, 子账户的额度限制也可以预防超支.

#### 操作透明性

- `allowance` 能够清晰地记录于展示账户(owner) & 代理(spender/proxy) 之间的关系, 可以作为一种可审计的授权链(chain).

### 与智能合约兼容

在区块链中, 智能合约是核心的业务执行实体, 而 `allowance` 和代理机制与其高度契合, 主要体现在以下的几个方面:

#### 自动化业务流程

智能合约需要自主执行复杂的逻辑, 例如去中心化交易所(DEX/Decentrailized-Exchange) 处理代币交易, DeFi 协议处理抵押借贷等等.
`allowance` 机制允许用户在执行智能合约之前, 提前设置授权额度, 这样一来合约会根据授权额度执行对应的操作, 这种方式极大避免了用户每次都要直接操作主账户种的余额, 大大的简化了流程.

#### 最小化权限于防止滥用

智能合约的安全性是区块链的核心问题之一, 直接操作用户的余额(balance) 可能导致风险扩大, 而通过 allowance, 用户明确制定可供操作的额度, 这样就限制了合约能触碰的范围.
例如, 用户/owner 授权了一个 DEX(spender/proxy) 100 个代币(token), 而不是授权整个账户的余额, 当合约执行完毕之后, 即便合约存在漏洞和风险, 最多这个合约也只能将这授权的 100 个代币给扣除掉, 主账户余额不会再继续存在被盗用的风险.

#### 支持复杂的链上逻辑

在链上的交互中, 很多场景都是需要用户预授权代币(例如, Uniswap 的流动性添加, Aave 的存款等等).
如果没有 `allowance` 机制, 这些操作都是需要用户每次手动介入,手动介入会大大降低用户体验和交易效率.
`allowance` 的存在, 使得链上的智能合约可以放心地操作自己已经授权的代币, 流程更加的顺畅，丝滑.

#### 兼容多方生态

区块链生态是多应用, 多协议的协同环境. 通过 `allowance` 一个账户可以兼容多个智能合约和 dApp, 而不会影响账户的安全性和独立性.

### 总结

**业务层面**
通过 `allowance` 机制实现账户于代理的分离, 确保不同的代理(spender/proxy) 之间的操作&业务隔离.
加强账户风险控制, 降低代理出问题对主账户的冲击.

**技术层面**
提供智能合约与账户二者之间的兼容性, 支持复杂的链上操作逻辑.
符合最小权限原则, 权限&授权操作&授权资金 粒度更精细化, 确保了代币授权的灵活性和安全性.

ERC-20 的设计理念不仅解决了业务需求, 还充分考虑了和智能合约技术的协同, 这种类似 Type-C 的"通用接口"设计理念, 成为了区块链生态发展重要的基石.
