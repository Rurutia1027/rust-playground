# Understand ERC-20

In our previous notes, we discussed [Ethereum](./0-Ethereum.md) and explored various protocols like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, highlighting their differences. Among these, **ERC-20** stands out as the foundation of Smart Contracts and plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem.

To gain a deeper understanding of ERC-20 , I plan to add detailed nots about its origin, the challenges developers faced in the Ethereum ecosystem before its innovation, and how ERC-20 addressed those issues. Additionally, I'll include pseudocode for ERC-20 data structures and its key associated functions to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Before ERC-20: The Problem Space

### Fragmentation of Token Standards

- Before ERC-20, there were no standardized ways to create, manage, or exchange tokens on Ethereum.
- Developers created custom smart contracts for each token, leading to significant variations in functionality and structure .
- Lack of standardization meant that wallets, exchange, and dApps had to build custom integrations for each tokne, creating inefficiencies.

### Manual and Inconsitent Exchange Mechanisms

- Exchanging tokens required complex, manual processes.
- Users had to interact with bespoke smart contracts, which often lead to errors, such as sending tokens to **incompatible addresses ** or **incorrect smart contract methods**.

### Scalability Challenges

Early blockchain-based systems could not support a thriving ecosystem of interoperable tokens. This stifled innovaiton and made it harder bo build decentrailized applications(dApps) that interacted with multiple tokens.

### Limited Programmability

Without a token standard, developers had to re-implement fundamental functions like tracking balances or transferring ownership for every project. This was inefficient and prone to bugs.

## The ROle of ERC-20: Why It Was Revolutionary

ERC-20, introduced in 2015, was desiged to standardize token creation and interactions on Ethereum. Here is why it is significant:

### Interoperability

- ERC-20 defined a **common interface** for tokens. Wallets, exchanges, and dApps could now interact with and ERC-20 token using the same set of methods (`transfer`, `approve`, `balanceOf`, etc.).
- This eliminated the need for custom integration and enabled seamless interactions between tokens and platforms.

### Automation and Programmability

- Functions like `balanceOf` and `transfer_from` simplified balance checking and token transfers, making them automated and error-resistant.
- Developers could build complex decentralized applications (DeFi protocols, gams, marketplaces) that relied on these standardized functions.

### Decentralized Exchanges

- ERC-20 enabled the creation of decentalized exchanges(DEXs) where tokens could be traded automatically through smart contracts (e.g., Unsawp).
- This was a game-changer, as it eliminated reliance on centralized intermediaries for token trading.

### Ecosystem Growth

- By providing a standard, ERC-20 reduced barriers to entry for developers. This lead to the explosion of tokenized assets like:
  > Utility tokens for dApps.
  > Governance tokens for DAOs.
  > Stablecoins like USDT, USDC.

## Key Features and Innovations of ERC-20

### Address-Based Token Ownership

### Allowance and Approval Mechainism

### Total Supply Standardization

The `totalSupply` function provided a way to query the total number of tokens issued, ensuring transparency.

### Event Logging

Events like `Transfer` and `Approval` enabled off-chain applications to track token transactions and approvals easily.

## Difference Between Exchange and 'Exchange' of Tokens in Blockchain ?

During learning blockchain basic concept, I often consused about the term `Exchange` and `Exchange Tokens Between Addresses`.
As a freshman like me get confused about this two concepts is easy, so I decide write down the difference between `Exchange` and `exchange tokens via Blockchain`.

### Exchange

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, an **Exchange** typically refers to:

**A Platform for Trading**

- A cryptocurrency exchange is a marketplace where users can **buy**, **sell**, or **trade cryptocurrencies**(e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or ERC-20 tokens).

- Types of Exchanges:

* **Centrailized Exchanges(CEXs)**

  > Platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
  > Operated by a central authority.
  > Require users to trust the platform with their funds.
  > Often offer advanced trading features(e.g., margin trading, futures)

* **Decentrailized Exchanges(DEXs)**
  > Platforms like **Uniswap** **SushiSwap** and **PanacksSwap**
  > Operate on a blockchain (smart contracts manage trades)
  > Users retain control their funds(no intermediaries).
  > Often used for swapping ERC-20 tokens directly.

### Exchange Tokens via Address

This refers to **transferring tokens directly** from one blockchain address to another.

- **What it Means**

* It involves sending tokens from **one wallet or account address** to another.
* The transfer is executed using blockchain transactions.
* No intermediary(like a exchange) is required for the transaction.

- **How It Relates to ERC-20**

ERC-20 tokens provide standard functions for transferring tokens between addresses:

- `transfer(address to, uint256 value):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens to the `to` address.
- `transfer_from(address from, address to, uint256 amount):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address.
  > This function often used in scenarios involving smart contracts.

## Post-ERC-20: Expanding The Ethereum EcoSystem

ERC-20 laid the foundaiton for Ethereum's token economy, but newer standards like ERC-721(NFTs) and ERC-1155(multi-token standard) expanded on its principles to meet emerging needs.

## How [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) Relates to ERC-20?

Platforms like Etherscan provide an interface to interact with and query data from **smart contracts**. Etherscan isn't specific to ERC-20, but it provide APIs for:

**Querying token balances**

**Tracking transactions**

**Getting Allowances(if public)**

### ERC20 in Rust

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct ERC20 {
  // balances:

  // value: balance amount
  balances: HashMap<String, u256>,

  // allowances:
  // key: owner
  // value: (spender -> spender's balance amount)
  allowances: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, u256>>,

  // total_supply: total supply of the token
  total_supply: u256
}

impl ERC20 {
  fn new(total_supply: u256) -> Self {
    let mut balances = HashMap::new();
    balances.insert("creator".to_string(), total_supply);

    Self {
      balances,
      allowances: HashMap::new(),
      total_supply,
    }
  }

  // get the balance amount by providing the address
  fn balance_of(&self, address: &str) -> u256 {
    *self.balances.get(address).unwrap_or(&0)
  }

  // transfer the amount of balance from 'from' address, to 'to' address
  fn transfer(&mut self, from: &str, to: &str, amount: u256) -> Result<(), String> {
    // first, get total amount of balance via the from address
    let from_balance = self.balances.get(from).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    // if from address's balance value < transfer amount value, return error message
    if from_balance < amount {
      return Err("Insufficient balance".into());
    }

    // minus corresponding amount of value from from address balance
    // and update the remain amount of the balance of the from address to the `balance` hash map
    self.balances.insert(from.into(), from_balance - amount);

    // get to address's balance value from `balances` hash map
    // if no to address's balance amount value, return 0 is ok
    let to_balance = self.balances.get(to).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    // add correspoinding amount of value to to address balance amount value
    // and update the (key, value) pair of (to address, updated to balance amount value) to the hash map of balances
    self.balances.insert(to.into(), to_balance + amount);

    // return ok
    Ok(())
  }


  // owner: owner of the token in the blockchain, represented by an address {either from or to address} wallet address
  // spender: object of authorized, like 3rd party or platform
  // approve: this function's definition means,
  // `owner` authorize a `spender` how many amout of the token the spender can use.
  // spender like the proxy of the owner to deal with some specific scenraios like buy stocks, buy foods or buy houses
  // then, owner owns its total tokens, and can authorize its tokens to multiple spender(s)
  // that's why owner:spender => 1:N
  // that's why in ERC-20 standard, allowance is defined as Map<String, Map<String, u256>>
  // the outer layer of Map key is the owner -> the address of wallet
  // the inner layer of Map key is the multiple proxies(spenders) and the tokens the owner deposited to the spenders
  // like you have 100 tokens --> this is your balance total amount, your total supply
  // and you have multiple wallet account address --> this is stored inside your balance this hash map
  // and despoite 10 tokens for food-spenders to buy Macolado humbergers
  // and desposite 20 tokens for buying NVIDIA stocks
  // and despoiste 50 tokens for buying houses in your country
  // and the remained tokens are stored in the balances and total_supply
  fn approve(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, amount: u256) {
    // here we get all owner's allowance list by owner value
    let owner_allowances = self.allowances.entry(owner.into()).or_default();

    // insert a new allowance item to the owner's allowance hash map
    // add a new proxy for the owner by limited amount of token
    owner_allowances.insert(spender.into(), amount);
  }

  // this function provides get owner's proxy the spender's allowance amount value
  // if owner's allowance list does not have this given spender
  // return 0 is ok
  fn allowance(&self, owner: &str, spender: &str) -> u256 {
    self.allowances
      .get(owner)
      .and_then(|spender_map| spender_map.get(spender))
      .cloned()
      .unwrap_or(0)
  }

  fn transfer_from(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, target_account_address: &str, amount: u256) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Step 1:Retrieve the spender's remaining allowance for the owner's tokens.
    let allowance = self.allowance(owner, spender);

    // Check if the spender's allowance is sufficient for the transfer
    if allowance < amount  {
      // If authorized spender does not have enough allowance, the transfer fails
      return Err("Allowance exceeded".into());
    }

    // Step 2: Check if the owner's total balance is sufficient for the transfer
    let owner_balance = self.balances.get(owner).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    if owner_balance < amount {
      // If the owner's balance is insufficient, the transfer fails.
      return Err("Insufficient balance".into());
    }
    // Step 3: Deduct the transfer amount from the spender's allowance.
    self.allowances.get_mut(owner).unwrap().insert(spender.into(), allowance - amount);

    // Step 4: Deduct the transfer amount from the owner's balance.
    self.balances.insert(owner.into(), owner_balance - amount);


    // Step 5: Add the transfer amount to the target account's balance.
    let to_balance = self.balances.get(target_account_address).cloned().unwrap_or(0);
    self.balances.insert(target_account_address.into(), to_balance + amount);

    Ok(())
  }
}
```

### Why in Pseudocode `transfer_from` Deduct From Both Balance and Allowance

**Balance**:
This represents the total number of tokens owned by an address(owner in this case).
Deducing from the balance ensures that the owner's tokens are correctly updated to reflect the transfer.

**Allowance**:
The allowance represents the tokens that a spender(proxy) is authorized to transfer on behalf of the owner.
Deducting from the allowance ensures that the spender cannot exceed the owner's approval.

**Why Both Are Deducted?**
The balance represents the actual token holdings of the owner.
The allowance is a temporary authorization and does not reduce the owner's token holding until the spender use it. When a transfer occurs:

- The spender's **allowance** is reduced because they are consuming part of their permission to spend.
- THe owner's **balance** is reduced because the actual tokens are transferred to another account.

### How Allowances and Balances Relate to Total Supply?

**Total Supply**:
This is the toal number of tokens that exist, as defined by the smart contract.
It does not change during token transfer(unless tokens are minted or burned).

The sum of all balances across all accounts equals the **totalSupply**.

Actually i have to say in the pseudocode, all of the inner objects, like **balances**, **allowances** and **totalSupply** they are all belong to the global scoped of the Blockchain System.
They are not local variables, and each operation(CRUD) like add, update, query and delete all requires Gas Fee.

Value of totalSupply in ERC-20 is not the total balance amount of current owner, instead it is the global all accounts' balance amount add together's value.

**Balances**:
Balances track the actual ownership of tokens for each account, and each balance contributes to the total supply.

**Allowances**:
Allowances are unrelated to the **totalSupply** directly. They are temporary permissions granted by owners to spenders.
The sum of all allowances for an owner can never exceeded the owner's balance. This ensures that spender cannot use more tokens than the owner actually owns.
If owner authorized spender amount > the owner balances, then the transfer_from will be failed during the second validation `amount < balance` then the real `transfer_from` will be blocked.

# The Design Philosophy of Allowance and Proxy(Spender) Mechanism in ERC-20

## Why Does ERC-20 Have the "Double Deduction" Logic in `transfer_from` for Both `balances` and `allowances` ?

```rust
  fn transfer_from(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, target_account_address: &str, amount: u256) -> Result<(), String> {
    let allowance = self.allowance(owner, spender);

    if allowance < amount  {
      return Err("Allowance exceeded".into());
    }

    let owner_balance = self.balances.get(owner).cloned().unwrap_or(0);

    if owner_balance < amount {
      return Err("Insufficient balance".into());
    }

    // after double checking the to be transferred amount value
    // with the
    // 1. owenr's authorized spender(proxy)'s allowance amount value
    // 2. owner's balance amount value

    // here execute the double minus amount from
    // 1. owner's spender's allowance amount
    // 2. owner's balance amount

    self.allowances.get_mut(owner).unwrap().insert(spender.into(), allowance - amount);
    self.balances.insert(owner.into(), owner_balance - amount);
    let to_balance = self.balances.get(target_account_address).cloned().unwrap_or(0);
    self.balances.insert(target_account_address.into(), to_balance + amount);

    Ok(())
  }

```

The design philosophy or ERC-20 is aimed at:

- **Authorization Management**: Clearly defining proxy usage permissions. The involvement of proxies(spenders) helps achieve better business-level isolation and differentiation of fund transfers.

- **Actual Ownership**: Ensuring that token transfers align with Ethereum's operational logic.

- **Error Handling**: Similar to a two-phase commit in databases, this mechanism enables Solidity to roll back transactions and prevent unauthorized token transfers.

However, beyond these aspects, the design mechanism of `allowance` and `spender`(which I interpret as proxy) in ERC-20 is not just about isolating fund management at the business level. It also lays the foundation for the design and implementation of **smart** contract business requirements. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with the implementation and operation of smart contracts.

### Business Isolation

- In various balance transfer business scenarios, the introduction of `allowance` and different proxies(spenders) enables more effective and fine-grained control over fund management.
- Through `allowance`, token owners can set individual authorization limits for different proxies (such as payment applications, exchanges, etc.), ensuring that each proxy operates only within its authorized scope without affecting other authorizations.
- For example, an account might authroize 10 tokens for a payment app(e.g., buying coffee) while authorizing 100 tokens for an invetment platform(e.g., purchasing stocks). These authorizations are independent of each other and do not interfere-similar to finer-grained permsision segmentation in an identical platform.

### Fund Security & Risk Control

- Without the `allowance` mechanism, all transfer operations could directly impact the account balance, potentially leanding to significant security risks.
- However, with the introduction of `allowance`, even if a proxy is compromised or misused, the risk is confined to the authorized limit due to its fine-grained segmentation.
- This mechanism cna be likned to sub-accounts or spending limits in banking systems. Even if main account holds a large balance, setting limits on sub-accounts helps prevent overspending.

#### Operational Transparency

- The `allowance` mechainism clearly records and displays the relationship between account owners and proxies (spenders), serving as an auditable chain of authorizaiton.

### Compatibility with Smart Contracts

In blockchain system, smart contracts are the core entities for executing business logic. The `allowance` and `proxy` mechanisms are highly compatible with smart contracts, as demostrated in the following aspects:

#### Automating Business Processes

Smart contracts autonomously execute complex operations, such as token exchanges on decentralized exchanges(DEXs) or handling collaterilzed loans in DeFi protocols.
The `allowance` mechanism allows users to pre-set authorization limits before executing smart contract. This enables the contract to perform operations based on the authorized limits, eliminating the need for users to interact directly with their primary balance every time. This significantly simplifies workflows.

#### Minimizing Permissions and Preventing Abuse

Security is a critical concern in blockchain, particularl when smart contracts directly access user balances. The `allowance` mechanism lets users explicitly define the token amount a smart contract can operate on, restricting its scope of action. For example, if a user authorizes a DEX(spender/proxy) to access 100 tokens, instead of granting access to the entire account balance, the contract can only deduct the authorized 100 tokens. Even if the contract is compromised, the risk is contained, and the primary account balance remains safe from further exploitation.

#### Supporting Complex On-Chain Logic

In blockchain interactions, many scenarios require users to pre-authorize tokens(e.g., adding liquidity on Unswap, depositing into Aave, etc.).
Without the `allowance` mechanism, these operations would require users to intervene manually each time, significantly reducing user experience and transaction efficiency.

#### Compatibility with a Multi-Party Ecosystem

The blockchain ecosystem thrives on multi-applicatoin, multi-protocol colalboration. Through the `allowance` mechanism, a single account can securely and independently interact with multiple smart contracts and dApps without compromising security or independence.

### Conclusion

**Business Perspective**
The `allowance` mechanism separates account control from proxy operations, ensuring operational and business isolation among different proxies(spenders).
It enhances account risk management, mitigating the impact the impact of proxy issues on the main account.

**Technical Perspective**
It ensures compatibility between smart contracts and accounts, supporting complex on-chain operational logic.
Aligned with the principle of least privilege, it provides finder granularity for permissions, authorization operations, and token allocations, ensuring token authorization is both flexibile and secure.

The design philosophy or ERC-20 not only address business requirements but also deeply integrates with the technical demands of smart contracts. This 'universal interface' design, akin to the concept of Type-C connectors, has become a foundational cornerstone for the grwoth of the blockchain ecosystem.

## Understanding the Logic of Refunding or Recharging Allowance Amount via `approve` function in ERC-20

The **allowance** authorization mechanism in ERC-20 relires on the `approve` function. Here is how its design and functionality work:

### Initial Authorization

The `approve` function enables the token owner to grant an initial token allowance to a specific spender(proxy).

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
```

By invoking this function, the owner to grant an initial token allowance to a specific spender(proxy).

### Updating the Allowance

ERC-20 does not provide a distinct "recharge" or "add allowance" function. However, you can simply call the `approve` function again to overwrite or adjust the spender's allowance.

```solidity
approve(spender, 100);
```

This updates the spender's allowance to the specific amount, regardless of any previous authorization.

**Note**: Calling `approve` with a new value completely overrides the existing allowance. If you want to `add` to the existing allowance, you must manually calculate the new total and pass it to `approve` function.

### Revoking or Resetting Allowance

If the owner wishes to revoke the spender's authorization, they can set the allowance to zero by calling function:

```solidity
approve(spender, 0);
```

This effectively clears the spender's ability and authorized permissions to manage any tokens, ensuring they can no longer interact with the owner's balance.

---

## ERC-20 approve Does Not Check balance for Allowance: Design Philosophy

```rust
  fn approve(&mut self, owner: &str, spender: &str, amount: u256) {
    // here we get all owner's allowance list by owner value
    let owner_allowances = self.allowances.entry(owner.into()).or_default();

    // insert a new allowance item to the owner's allowance hash map
    // add a new proxy for the owner by limited amount of token
    owner_allowances.insert(spender.into(), amount);
  }
```

In ERC-20, when the `approve` function is used to grant an allowance to a spender(proxy), we observe that there is no explicit check to compare the owner's balance with the authorized amount. For instance, there is not logic like this:

```rust
if balances.get(owenr.into()) < amount {
  return Err("Insufficient balance of owner {}", owner.into());
}
```

So, why is this the case ?

**Design Philosophy: Authorization vs. Locking Funds**
The primary role of `approve` function in ERC-20 is to grant a spender(proxy) the maximum amount of tokens they are allowed to spend on behalf of the owner **in the future**. It is not tied to any actual transfer or locing of funds at the time of authorization.

`approve` is a **commitment, not 'locking' the funds**.

The `approve` operation is logically setting a limit on the amount of tokens a spender can use in the future. It does not lock or freeze the tokens in the owner's balance. The owner's balance is not affected by this authorization, and the tokens are still freely available for the owner to transfer or interact with.

**Deferred Valdiation Logic**
The reason `approve` doesn't check the balance is that the balance is dynamic and can change at any time. The actual validation of both allowance and the balance happens only when the `transfer_from` function is invoked to make the acutal transfer. At that point, the system checks whether

- The allowance is sufficient for the requeste transfer amount.
- The owner has enough balance to cover the transfer.

This deferred check ensures that the system is flexible, as it doesn't preemptively block the owner's ability to authorize a future transfer, even if their balance is lower at the time of authorization.

**Efficienty of On-Chain Operations**

**Gas** costs are a significant consideration when designing on-chain operaitons like those in Ethereum. By avoiding balance checks within the `approve` function, the system reduces unndecssary gas consumption:

- Checking the balance or the allowance in `approve` would involve additional state access, which would incur unnecessary gas costs, especially in scenarios where the state might change frequently.

Since `approve` is just setting up a future condition for the spender, there is no immediate need to access the global state (balance) at this stage. The balance check is only relevant when the actual transfer occurs via `transfer_from`, which is the operaiton that triggers the gas fee calculaiton.

#### Summary of Key Points of `approve` in ERC-20

- `approve` is a logic commitment, not a locking (balance) fund mechanism.
- Deferred balance and allowance checks.
- Efficienty in Gas Usage
