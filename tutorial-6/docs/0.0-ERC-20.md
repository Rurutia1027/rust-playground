# Understand ERC-20

In our previous notes, we discussed [Ethereum](./0-Ethereum.md) and explored various protocols like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, highlighting their differences. Among these, **ERC-20** stands out as the foundation of Smart Contracts and plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem.

To gain a deeper understanding of ERC-20 , I plan to add detailed nots about its origin, the challenges developers faced in the Ethereum ecosystem before its innovation, and how ERC-20 addressed those issues. Additionally, I'll include pseudocode for ERC-20 data structures and its key associated functions to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Before ERC-20: The Problem Space

### Fragmentation of Token Standards

- Before ERC-20, there were no standardized ways to create, manage, or exchange tokens on Ethereum.
- Developers created custom smart contracts for each token, leading to significant variations in functionality and structure .
- Lack of standardization meant that wallets, exchange, and dApps had to build custom integrations for each tokne, creating inefficiencies.

### Manual and Inconsitent Exchange Mechanisms

- Exchanging tokens required complex, manual processes.
- Users had to interact with bespoke smart contracts, which often lead to errors, such as sending tokens to **incompatible addresses ** or **incorrect smart contract methods**.

### Scalability Challenges

Early blockchain-based systems could not support a thriving ecosystem of interoperable tokens. This stifled innovaiton and made it harder bo build decentrailized applications(dApps) that interacted with multiple tokens.

### Limited Programmability

Without a token standard, developers had to re-implement fundamental functions like tracking balances or transferring ownership for every project. This was inefficient and prone to bugs.

## The ROle of ERC-20: Why It Was Revolutionary

ERC-20, introduced in 2015, was desiged to standardize token creation and interactions on Ethereum. Here is why it is significant:

### Interoperability

- ERC-20 defined a **common interface** for tokens. Wallets, exchanges, and dApps could now interact with and ERC-20 token using the same set of methods (`transfer`, `approve`, `balanceOf`, etc.).
- This eliminated the need for custom integration and enabled seamless interactions between tokens and platforms.

### Automation and Programmability

- Functions like `balanceOf` and `transferFrom` simplified balance checking and token transfers, making them automated and error-resistant.
- Developers could build complex decentralized applications (DeFi protocols, gams, marketplaces) that relied on these standardized functions.

### Decentralized Exchanges

- ERC-20 enabled the creation of decentalized exchanges(DEXs) where tokens could be traded automatically through smart contracts (e.g., Unsawp).
- This was a game-changer, as it eliminated reliance on centralized intermediaries for token trading.

### Ecosystem Growth

- By providing a standard, ERC-20 reduced barriers to entry for developers. This lead to the explosion of tokenized assets like:
  > Utility tokens for dApps.
  > Governance tokens for DAOs.
  > Stablecoins like USDT, USDC.

## Key Features and Innovations of ERC-20

### Address-Based Token Ownership

### Allowance and Approval Mechainism

### Total Supply Standardization

The `totalSupply` function provided a way to query the total number of tokens issued, ensuring transparency.

### Event Logging

Events like `Transfer` and `Approval` enabled off-chain applications to track token transactions and approvals easily.

## Difference Between Transaction Tokens and Exchange in Blockchain ?

During learning blockchain basic concept, I often consused about the term `Exchange` and `Exchange Tokens Between Addresses`.
To a freshman like me get confused about this two concepts is common, so I decide write down the difference between `DEX(decentralized-exchange)` and `exchange tokens via Blockchain`.

### Exchange

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, an **Exchange** typically refers to:

**A Platform for Trading**

- A cryptocurrency exchange is a marketplace where users can **buy**, **sell**, or **trade cryptocurrencies**(e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or ERC-20 tokens).

- Types of Exchanges:

* **Centrailized Exchanges(CEXs)**

  > Platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
  > Operated by a central authority.
  > Require users to trust the platform with their funds.
  > Often offer advanced trading features(e.g., margin trading, futures)

* **Decentrailized Exchanges(DEXs)**
  > Platforms like **Uniswap** **SushiSwap** and **PanacksSwap**
  > Operate on a blockchain (smart contracts manage trades)
  > Users retain control their funds(no intermediaries).
  > Often used for swapping ERC-20 tokens directly.

### Exchange Tokens via Address

This refers to **transferring tokens directly** from one blockchain address to another.

- **What it Means**

* It involves sending tokens from **one wallet or account address** to another.
* The transfer is executed using blockchain transactions.
* No intermediary(like a exchange) is required for the transaction.

- **How It Relates to ERC-20**
  ERC-20 tokens provide standard functions for transferring tokens between addresses:

* `transfer(address to, uint256 value):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens to the `to` address.
* `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount):`
  > Moves value amount of tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address.
  > This function often used in scenarios involving smart contracts.
