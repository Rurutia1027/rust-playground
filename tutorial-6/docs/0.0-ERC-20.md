# Understand ERC-20

In our previous notes, we discussed [Ethereum](./0-Ethereum.md) and explored various protocols like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, highlighting their differences. Among these, **ERC-20** stands out as the foundation of Smart Contracts and plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem.

To gain a deeper understanding of ERC-20 , I plan to add detailed nots about its origin, the challenges developers faced in the Ethereum ecosystem before its innovation, and how ERC-20 addressed those issues. Additionally, I'll include pseudocode for ERC-20 data structures and its key associated functions to provide a comprehensive overview.
